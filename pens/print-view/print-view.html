    <h1>Printing a Webpage</h1>

    <p>Print has a user experience that's been honed over hundreds of years, so it shouldn't come as a shock to us that some people still prefer to look at information on a printed page.&nbsp;If you've got content that you suspect some user at some point might want to print (a travel itinerary, short novel, CV, etc.), you'll want to make sure you style for that. Along with all your careful responsive CSS styling, you can take things to the next level with a custom print stylesheet as well.</p>

    <section data-type="sect1">
      <h1>Page Layout</h1>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.baidu.com">first potential</a> issue when re-working CSS for print is the basic page layout. If your website is just a plain linear flow of text, then this won't be a big problem for you. But unfortunately, web designers these days are pretty darn good at making complex, beautiful layouts for the Web, using things like absolute or fixed positioning, floats and grids, banners, and so on, to create a responsive website that looks great on any digital device. Our task is to figure out how to translate that design for print as well.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The first step in writing the print CSS is to look at the content and think about the best way it would look as a printed page. Ask yourself some questions about the content, for example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is there a banner of some kind at the top of the web page? Will that banner work in print? Is there a way to make it look better, or optimize it for a printed page?</li>
        <li>Is there a navigation menu? Does the navigation menu need to be as easily seen as it does on the web page? What is the purpose of the navigation menu? Is the navigation menu even necessary on the printed page?</li>
        <li>Does the main content have inconsistent margins, or elements that float out into the page margin? Is it possible/practical to preserve this effect in print, or should all the content flow in a single block with a set margin?</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="page-break"></div>
      <p>Remember that you can't expect your audience to all have the exact same printer, as well. Think about how printer margins, paper sizes, inks, and so on, might vary amongst your users, and be sure to answer these questions in light of those differences.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You also need to consider the flow of the actual source HTML, and the framework behind the page. In most cases, you don't want to rework the content markup for the print output--instead, you want to write CSS on top of that markup. For example, in the source flow, if the navigation menu is located before the main content, you don't want to cut-and-paste the code block for that nav menu to move it to a different spot; instead, you need to find a way to negotiate both leaving the source alone and getting it to look good in print.</p>

      <p>Many frameworks and websites these days use the concept of a
        <em>grid</em> to set up the page. The grid is a well-established tool in the field of graphic design, with a slight twist when it comes to CSS. A grid in web design generally consists of a fixed number of blocks the stretch the allowed content area. Sometimes the content area is the entire screen width (however much that may be, since screens come in all shapes and sizes), and sometimes the content area is set to a fixed width that changes based on common screen sizes (for example, the allowed content area may be 900px for a PC, and then switch to 100% width for a smartphone). Additionally, the grid divisions may be set to fixed sizes (for example, each grid column is 60px with a 20px margin), or may be set to a percentage of the content area (each grid column is 10% of the content area, again with a 20px margin).
      </p>

      <p>INSERT FIGURE: the grid</p>

      <p>If your web page uses a reflowable grid based on floats, then you may be able to leverage that CSS when optimizing for print. Try printing the page out too see if you need to completely rework the layout, of if you can start with the existing grid. We'll dive deeper into some tactics to rework specific CSS properties in the following sections.</p>

      <h1>Units of Measure</h1>

      <p>We're used to pixels and ems in the web world, but these are equally inappropriate for the print world. What is a pixel on a piece of paper? Because we're dealing with fixed measures, it's appropriate to use a unit that corresponds to that measure. Inches (in) and points (pt) are both great (you could also use percentages, though results will vary depending on how and where you use it).</p>
